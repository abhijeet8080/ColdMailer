      I hope this message finds you well. I'm Abhijeet Kadam, I am currently in my final year of a B.Tech degree at Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune. 
      I’m reaching out because I want to work as an SDE Intern at ${person.company_name}.

    <p>I totally understand that you’re busy, so let me tell you briefly about myself:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I have solved over 300+ problems across different platforms (e.g., LeetCode, GFG).</li>
        <li>I’m proficient with React, Typescript, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML5, CSS, and Java. I’m also proficient with DSA.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I believe I have the required skills and would mesh well with the culture at ${person.company_name}.</p>
    <p>Would you be open to reviewing my profile for the SDE Intern role?</p>
    <p>I’d also be happy to provide additional information if required. I’d appreciate the chance to discuss how my background could be a good fit.</p>
